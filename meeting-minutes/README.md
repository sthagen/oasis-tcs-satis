# Meeting Minutes

This is an area where the TC may decide to provide mneeting minutes in a format that is ideally directly rendered for readers and for search to optimize the public interface of the TC.

When using markdown, anyone can directly refer to sections in such minutes to communicate with ease in issues, pull-requests,
and towards OASIS administration in requests that require a documented will of the TC in minutes more directly.
