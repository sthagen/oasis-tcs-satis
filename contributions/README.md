# Contributions

Inside this folder tree contributions to the OASIS SATIS TC may be placed.

Contributors are encouraged to create kekab-style-named subfolders including
a README.md, a LICENSE file, and the contribution itself to best document
the provenance as well as the fact that the TC may consider the content but
is not obliged to use it.

Maintainers should be able to support contributors in depositing their content
with the least amount of delay per a peer reviewd change-set or in GitHub
language a pull request.
